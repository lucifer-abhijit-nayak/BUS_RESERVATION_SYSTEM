# BUS_RESERVATION_SYSTEM
The Repository has a proper indented and functioning code for a bus reservation system.  
It helps in keeping a track on multiple bus services and even modify the details as per our requirement.
Every bus number is registered with the driver's name,its route and the arrival and departure time.

It is a C++ language code. 
I did the project for MyCaptain C++ course.


The program is well checked for any edge situation. It can be runned in C++14(g++ 5.4.0) compiler.

...HAPPY CODING...
